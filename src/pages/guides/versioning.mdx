# Versioning

How the version numbers are incremented in an NDS package.

## Semantic Versioning

All NDS packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer), which allows for three types of changes:

- `PATCH` changes for backwards compatible bug fixes,
- `MINOR` changes for new functionality added in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `MAJOR` changes for incompatible API changes

These changes are represented in the version number like `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For version `3.2.4`, that would mean there has been 4 fixes and 2 new features since the last breaking change.

## Major Changes

Major version updates are for breaking changes, and may require updates to applications already consuming the package. For example:

- Removing a prop
- Renaming a prop
- Changing the way an existing prop works
- Changing the name of a component
- Removing a component
- Visual updates that could affect the layout of a page, like box-sizing, width, height
- Changes to fonts that could cause wrapping changes, e.g font-size, font-weight, or letter-spacing

## Minor Changes

Minor changes are additive changes with backwards compatiblity. For example:

- Adding a new component or feature
- Adding new, optional props to an existing component
- Deprecating something and adding a replacement
- Visual updates to aesthetic features like colour and shadows
- Visual updates to layered components like tooltips that won't affect the layout of a page

## Patch Changes

Patch changes are for fixing defects and optimizing existing code. For example:

- Fixing a defect
- Adding or updating tests
- Updating or refactoring existing code in a way that doesn't alter the API
