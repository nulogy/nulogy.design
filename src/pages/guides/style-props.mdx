# Style Props

Nulogy's components use styled-system to apply groups of style props to different types of components. These props correspond to their css equivalents and allow individual manipulation of a component's style.

## Prop categories

| Category     | Props                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For more information on each of these props, see the [styled-system docs](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md).

## Usage

To see which props each component includes, see that component's documentation. But in general, the following rules apply:

- Block-level components (Alerts, Buttons, Cards, etc.) have access to space props.
- Text components (Text, Headings, Link) also have access to typography and colour props.
- The Box component has access to layout props and can be used to add borders, colours, and boxShadows around anything.

<Alert>
  Note that inputs don't have access to any of these props because they're
  already pre-composed. To stack multiple inputs with proper spacing on top of
  each other, wrap them in the{" "}
  <Link href="https://nulogy.design/components/form">Form</Link> component.
</Alert>

## Theme

Styled-system will check the [theme](/theme) and use that if a key matches, e.g setting a `textColor` to `blue` will display Nulogy's `#216beb`, instead of the html default. If a key can't be found, it will be processed as a CSS value.
