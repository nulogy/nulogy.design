# Localization

NDS components include some default strings for commonly used labels and aria-labels.

To pass a locale to NDSProvider, locate the NDSProvider within your app and pass in the locale prop.

`<NDSProvider locale={yourLocale} />`

The default language used by these strings is English (US) unless a different locale is passed to the NDSProvider. All strings within NDS can be overridden using the component's props.

To see an example of a localized component, go to the [Pagination](https://master--5f60c6c285eaad0022dce67f.chromatic.com/?path=/story/components-pagination--pagination) story and in the "Knobs" section you should be able to select an NDS Provider Locale from a dropdown and observe the labels translate according to the selected locale.

## Available NDS Locales

Below is a list of all locales currently accepted by NDSProvider. Use the "Locale Prop Value" as the string value to pass to NDSProvider's locale prop.
