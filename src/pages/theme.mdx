import { theme } from "@nulogy/components";
import { CODE_BLOCK } from "../components/CodeBlock.js";

# Theme

All the available design options for creating interfaces in Nulogy's style can be accessed in Javascript via the theme.

```jsx
{
  JSON.stringify(theme, null, "  ");
}
```

## Usage

The theme can be accessed via our building block component props. E.g a [Box](/components/box)'s `backgroundColor` prop will map to the `colours` object in our theme. Similarly, a [Text](/components/Text)

## Custom themes

As of version 3.0, themes can be overriden at the NDSProvider level. This allows changing all definitions of a property at once.

For example, if you were working in PackManager and wanted the "medium" font size used in all components to be 14px instead of 16px:

```jsx
import { NDSProvider } from "@nulogy/components"

<NDSProvider theme={fontSizes: {medium: "14px"}}>
    // app
</NDSProvider>
```

<Alert fontSize="20px" mt="x4">
  This is a powerful feature, but should be used sparingly. Please let Design
  Ops know when you've overriden the theme for any reason, in case there are
  systemic problems we could be solving in the system directly instead.
</Alert>
