# Switcher

A switcher allows the user to toggle between 2 or more options.

<Playground {...config} />

## Use when
- Organizing, grouping, or filtering data and content
- Needing to toggle between different ways to organize data. Such as visualizing data in a grid vs table format, group data by different facets, or to immediately filter content displayed in a section of a page
- Giving the user a way to immediately manipulate the UI without the need of a submit button

## Don't use when
- Navigating between different sets of data or distinct sets of content that live separately. Tabs should be used instead
- The use case calls for more than one option being selected at a time. Checkboxes should be used instead
- Used as a form input. Radio buttons should be used instead
- Used as an on/off selection component. Toggles should be used instead
- The use case calls for more than 4 options, a dropdown should be used instead

## Interaction guidelines
When a user uses a switcher, ideally, only the content being switched should be reloaded or reorganized. To prevent loss of context, the switcher and any navigation components should remain visible.

## Accessibility
Considering the intended use of the switcher — a low-risk control component for organizing content in different ways — it can be used without a label when the set of options are descriptive enough by themselves. In this case, a hidden label should be used.
