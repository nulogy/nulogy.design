# Flex

A wrapper component that extends [Box](/box) to create layouts using Flexbox.

<Playground {...config} />

### Responsive

Like Box, all props can be used responsively by using an object that defines small, medium and/or large, based on the [theme.breakpoints](https://nulogy.design/theme/) object

This example displays columns on small screens and rows on large ones.

<Example componentName="flex" scope={{ Flex, Box }} example="ResponsiveFlex" />

## Props

<PropsTable propsConfig={config.props} />

## Content guidelines

To provide a more detailed explanation of the message that is being communicated, a link to the new screen can be provided in the child content using a Link component.
