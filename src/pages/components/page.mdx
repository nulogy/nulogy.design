# Page

There are three components we use to build up Nulogy's standard layout: An ApplicationFrame, a Page, and an optional Sidebar.

The Page component wraps the actual content of a page, and provides consistent positioning for the Title and Breadcrumb components. This will be used many times, wrapping each page that gets created.

<Playground {...config} />

## Props

<PropsTable propsConfig={config.props} />

## Content guidelines

To provide a more detailed explanation of the message that is being communicated, a link to the new screen can be provided in the child content using a Link component.
