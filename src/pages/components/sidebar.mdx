The Sidebar is designed for displaying additional information or editing/creating new items. The component provides animation, a close button, and consistent paddings and title positioining. Sidebars are always optional, and can be used on any Page you like.

It is intended to be used within the [ApplicationFrame](/application-frame) and along side [BrandedNavBar](/branded-nav-bar).

See props for accessibility features.
