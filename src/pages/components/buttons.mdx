# Button

Buttons make common actions immediately detectable and easy to perform.

<Playground {...config} />

## Types of buttons

There are three other types of buttons for different contexts, which all share the same properties as `Button`. They can be imported as their own components, e.g:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { QuietButton } from "@nulogy/components";

export default () => {
  return <PrimaryButton>Create project</PrimaryButton>;
};
```

<Flex
  maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH}
  m="0 auto"
  alignItems="center"
  justifyContent="space-between"
  mb="x4"
>
  <Box maxWidth="75%">
    <Heading3>PrimaryButton</Heading3>
    <Text fontSize="20px">
      PrimaryButtons are used for the main action in a particular context. There
      is usually not more than one primary button per screen and not all of the
      screens require a Primary button.
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <PrimaryButton>Create project</PrimaryButton>
  </Box>
</Flex>

<Flex
  maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH}
  m="0 auto"
  alignItems="center"
  justifyContent="space-between"
  mb="x4"
>
  <Box maxWidth="75%">
    <Heading3>DangerButton</Heading3>
    <Text fontSize="20px">
      DangerButtons are used for destructive actions such as deleting. They are
      most likely to appear in confirmation dialogs.
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <DangerButton>Cancel project</DangerButton>
  </Box>
</Flex>

<Flex
  maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH}
  m="0 auto"
  alignItems="center"
  justifyContent="space-between"
>
  <Box maxWidth="75%">
    <Heading3>QuietButton</Heading3>
    <Text fontSize="20px">
      QuietButtons are used for less important actions such as “Cancel” or
      actions that are not directly related to the context of the page (e.g
      Learn more …). Quiet buttons are often paired with a Primary button.
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <QuietButton>See more details</QuietButton>
  </Box>
</Flex>

## Content and UX guidelines

### Labelling

- Always lead with an actionable verb.
- Whenever possible follow with a clear noun (e.g: Create shipment, Approve delivery).
- Always use sentence case.

### Grouping

- Use the [ButtonGroup](/components/buttongroup) component to associate a group of buttons together.
- Order buttons in a group from most important on the left to least important on the right.
- Only have one `PrimaryButton` or `DangerButton` on the page at one time
